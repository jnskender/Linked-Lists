#Linked List
[View Project Requirements](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/linked-lists?ref=lnav)

This is my implementation of a Linked List data structure with Ruby.    
This is for learning purposes only as Ruby arrays can perform the same functionality in essence.  

[main.rb](https://github.com/jnskender/Linked-Lists/blob/master/main.rb) contains the testing of  
Linked_List.rb
and Node.rb  

main.rb also shows console output in comments
